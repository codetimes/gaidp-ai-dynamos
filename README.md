## 🏃 How to Run

### Overview
This project consists of:
- A **Python backend** running on Google Colab, utilizing Flask.
- A **Next.js frontend** for the user interface.
- **Ngrok** to expose the backend publicly.

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project.

---

### Backend Setup

1. Open the provided **Google Colab** notebook.
2. Run all the cells to start the backend service.
3. Once the backend is running, you will get the ngRok tunnel link as below :
   ```sh
   Public URL: NgrokTunnel: https://<ngrok-link>.ngrok-free.app
   ```
4. Copy the **public URL** generated by Ngrok. This will be used in the frontend.

---

### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd <project-folder>
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the Next.js development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Run on browser:
   ```sh
   http://localhost:3000/
   ```

---

### Linking Frontend with Backend

1. Open the frontend application in the browser.
2. On the **top-right corner**, find the **Link Setup** option.
3. Enter the **Ngrok tunnel URL** obtained from the backend.
4. Save the link, and the frontend will now communicate with the backend.

---

### Additional Notes
- Ensure that the backend remains active while using the frontend.
- If the backend restarts, a new Ngrok URL will be generated. Update the frontend accordingly.
